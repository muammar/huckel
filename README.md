huckel
======

This is a python program that takes your MOLPRO output file, and from the
Cartesian coordinates, it forms a Huckel hamiltonian matrix to then give you
the eigenvalues to be plotted as showed in _M. El Khatib, S. Evangelisti, T.
Leininger, and G. L. Bendazzoli, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2012, 14, 15666â€“76_.

Right now the program is still in development.

More information soon.
