These are some examples for a rhomboidal closed polyacene structure in which you
have that all the internuclear distances are not the same. For reproducing this
spectrum, the interval of distances to add as input is `2.3 bohr` to `2.99 bohr`.

In `l4_pub_noextradeletion.dat` you have the data to form the Huckel spectrum
shown in Figure `l4_pub_noextradeletion.png`. You can compare this figure with
Figure 6 in _M. El Khatib, S.  Evangelisti, T.  Leininger, and G. L.
Bendazzoli, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2012, 14, 15666â€“76_.

In `l4_pub_extradeletion.dat` you have the data to form the Huckel spectrum
shown in Figure `l4_pub_extradeletion.png`. In this case, some additional
carbon atoms where deleted from the coordinates.
