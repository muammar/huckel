This is an example for a rhomboidal closed polyacene structure in which you
have that all the internuclear distances are not the same. For reproducing this
spectrum, the interval of distances to add as input is `2.3 bohr` to `2.99 bohr`.

In `huckel.dat` you have the data to form the Huckel spectrum shown in Figure
`l4_pub.png`. You can compare this figure with Figure 6 in _M. El Khatib, S.
Evangelisti, T.  Leininger, and G. L.  Bendazzoli, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.,
2012, 14, 15666â€“76_.
